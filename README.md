# MandelbrotViewer
A simple Mandelbrot fractal viewer with versions in java and python that displays directly from the command prompt with minimal imports. Recommended wide window for command prompt.

Max number of iterations can be changed from default 1000 in MandelbrotViewer.java line 4, MandelbrotViewer.py line 1.

Frame size can be changed from default 50 in MandelbrotViewer.java line 6, MandelbrotViewer.py line 2.

Zoom multiplyer can be changed from default 2 in MandelbrotViewer.java line 8, MandelbrotViewer.py line 3.

# Key
* "X"'s represent complex numbers that are in the Mandelbrot set (have passed through all iterations).
* "^"'s represent complex numbers that have passed through 10% of iterations.
* "<"'s represent complex numbers that have passed trough 25% of iterations.
* "+"'s represent complex numbers that have passed trough 35% of iterations.
* "* "'s represent complex numbers that have passed trough 50% of iterations.
* ">"'s represent complex numbers that have passed trough 60% of iterations.
* "#"'s represent complex numbers that have passed trough 75% of iterations.
