# Key:
* "X"'s represent complex numbers that are in the Mandelbrot set (have passed through all iterations).
* "^"'s represent complex numbers that have passed through 10% of iterations.
* "<"'s represent complex numbers thait have passed trough 25% of iterations.
* "+"'s represent complex numbers thait have passed trough 35% of iterations.
* "* "'s represent complex numbers thait have passed trough 50% of iterations.
* ">"'s represent complex numbers thait have passed trough 60% of iterations.
* "#"'s represent complex numbers thait have passed trough 75% of iterations.
